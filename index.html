    <p>RiskSnap was founded in August 2017 by a small, passionate team that first worked together on risk projects ten years earlier. 
       Financial risk is very much in our DNA, we have a strong foundation in current regulatory risk methodologies
       and building financial risk software. We have set out to produce best-in-class financial risk software for banks, exchanges, corporate hedgers, 
       investors, asset managers, custodians, insurance firms, and pension fund administrators.
