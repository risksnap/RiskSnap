    <p>The US Treasury Yield curve currently has an interesting pattern based on 10 year data where there is definite flattening of the yield curve with one year rates rising rapidly.  Long term yields embed(*) future expectations of short term interest rates, suggesting that rates in the future will be low.  With short term rates rising currently, a straight-line projection should indicate that long term yields will rise also.  Since that is not happening, the counter-intuitive reasoning is possibly that current high rates will depress future economic growth.  (Data Source:  US Federal Reserve).

    *Bootstrapping of interest rates is a method used to price fixed rate and floating rate instruments consistently.  In this methodology the discounted sum of bond coupon payments equals the discounted sum of the expected short tem interest rates.    In fixed income analytics, using annual time periods,

<p>Volatility is a risk factor for the pricing of options.  This graph plots historical standard deviations for RBOB Regular Gasoline (New York Harbor) Nymex Futures.  Unlike many risk factors where highest risk was observed during the financial crisis of 2008, energy volatility is a function of not only economic/political factors, but of weather. At the end of August, wholesale gasoline jumped nearly 14% due to tropical storm Harvey. (Data Source: Energy Information Administration (EIA).
