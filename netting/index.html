	<p>The volatility of a portfolio is lower than the sum of the volatility of the underlying assets due to the correlation effect.  Consider a portfolio of 2 assets that are 100% negatively correlated.  There will be zero risk while this correlation is in effect.  A portfolio of 2 assets that are 100% positively correlated will generally have twice the volatility of either).  For a 2 asset portfolio, the variance can be measured as A<sup>2</sup> + &#961;AB + B<sup>2</sup> where A and B are the  volatilities and &#961; is the correlation which ranges from -1 to +1. The volatility is the square root of the variance.
    <p>
	<p>The following demonstrates how rebalancing a portfolio by adding a hedge position reduces the overall risk.  The portfolio is long shares and offsets the risk by adding a put option.  The first graph shows the risk of the shares alone.  The second graph shows the risk from the put option alone.  For stress analysis a regulatory requirement is to cover risk during a 365 calendar window that includes the worst day over a period up to and including 2007.  The stress period for the equity is centered around 12 Nov 2008, and for the put, around 26 Jan 2010.  The risk to the long equity position is from a fall and prices, and to the put, a rise in prices.  The combining of the two assets results in a different profile.  In the combined portfolio, the original risk observation period is still valid since the worst case loss for the two assets together still takes place in the same date range. <a href="http://www.risksnap.com/metrics/index.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information on observation date requirements</a>.

	<p>The following illustrates the possible risk (in Thousands of dollars), using a 99% confidence interval and 2 day holding period, with at-the-money historical volatility.
<p>
<p>	There is a significant reduction in the amount at risk.  Note that there is a cost to buying this risk protection in the form of option premium.  In practice the cost is lowered by purchasing out-of-the money options and various risk vs cost strategies.  HVaR is useful for viewing the risk of such strategic portfolios.

<h2>Portfolio Example - Berkshire-Hathaway</h2>
<div class="a">    
	<p>Berkshire Hathaway is the worldâ€™s largest financial services company by revenue ($210.8 B) Wikipedia org.  The U.S. stocks owned by Berkshire Hathaway, as reported to the SEC is updated by CNBC. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/" target="_blank">CNBC Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker</a>. The portfolio as of Apr 3, 2018, consisted of 47 shares with a total value of $174.3 Billion. The risk profile for 100 shares of each of the stocks is on RiskSnap's home page.  The Berkshire portfolio consisted then of 3 million shares with varied distribution.  
    <p>
	<p>The portfolio was netted for those shares where history covered the period from Feb 2008.  Shares where the historical data was insufficient, were not netted.  The netted portfolio Expected Shortfall during the stress period was $25.2 billion with worst case being price changes as experienced Jan 20, 2009.  The sum of the netted portfolio and the remaining unnetted porfolios results in an Expected Shortfall of $29.1B or a 16.7% drop.  This is possibly conservative since no netting is provided for the stocks with not enough history.  The ES during the stress period for a single share is $29,000 or slightly less than 10% of the current share price of $296,859 (Apr 3, 2018) , with the worst loss being Nov 19, 2008. The ES loss is consistent with the share price drop of 12%.
