<h3 class="three-col-header">Thoughts on Risk Factors for the day</h3>
<p>
<h1 style="color:blue;">Housing Prices and Pelegrini</h1>
<p class="paragraph">In 2007 I attended a hedge fund conference in Nassau where a Paulson & Co representative showed an interesting chart on housing.  John Paulson became world-famous in 2007 by shorting the US housing market in front of the subprime mortgage crisis and bet against mortgage backed securities by investing in credit default swaps. Mr. Paulson's firm made $14Billion and Paulson himself made $4Billion on this one trade alone. 
<p>Noticing that the rate of change in housing prices are falling, mirrored by a similar trend in the 3 homebuilding stocks in the S&P500 (Lennar Corporation (LEN), D.R Horton (DHI) and NVR. Inc (NVR), and also bolstered by the unrelenting increase in interest rates over the same period, it seemed worthwhile to reproduce the chart based on current data.  
<p>A chart similar to Paolo Pellegrini's is produced below.  Mr. Pelegrini, who was the analyst working with Mr. Paulson, used the inflation-adjusted growth in housing prices divided by wage growth according to one source. The chart below uses the year over year change in the seasonally adjusted housing price index divided by the inflation-adjusted hourly wage growth. The ratio stopped increasing around April 2018 and has fallen close to its lowest point over the period displayed. (T. Murk)
<p>Var results for LEN and DHI covering 10 years are shown below.  Yield curves for other currencies can be found under market risk factors.

<h3 class="three-col-header">VaR as a Risk Measure</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Value at Risk (VaR) is one of the most popular tools used in risk management and is incorporated within the Basel Accord for banking supervision.  VaR is used by central counterparties (CCPs) for purposes of determining initial margin.  VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES) are standard measures used by traders for setting risk limits and can be used by investors, traders and risk managers both for preventing panic selling (or buying) in periods of high volatility, and also preventing overreaching in periods of low volatility.
<p> Our core solution is VaR.
<p>
<p>A click on the chart icons below for various assets and sectors, will provide a graph where the one in one hundred chance (99th percentile) breach is visible below the Current VaR red line .
