<H3>Option Pricer</H3>
 
<p>The Black-Scholes generalized formula can be used to price european options on stocks without dividends (the original model by Black and Scholes, 1973), options on stocks with a continuous dividend yield (Merton,1973), options on futures (Black 1976) and options on currencies (Garman and Kohlhagen - 1983). There are slight differences between the models, and this download presents the basic three (equity, future and foreign exchange), on one form.
