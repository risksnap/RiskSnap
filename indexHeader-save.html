<h1 style="color:blue;">Chiming in on the FANG barrier</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Four Equity Securities, due July 1, 2021,  issued by RBC June 29th, 2018, in amount of $1,424,000 pay a superior coupon, 10.2% pa subject to an automatic call and a barrier based worst return of 4 FANG stocks, Amazon (“AMZN”), Facebook (“FB”), Alphabet (“GOOGL”) and Netflix (“NFLX).
<p>A 2.55% coupon is paid each quarter. However, starting Dec 27th an automatic call occurs if on a payment date all four stocks are greater than initial price.  Otherwise at maturity, if the price of the lowest return stock is below a barrier (50% of initial price), then that return applies to the entire amount (also no coupon is paid for that date).  For example, if initial price of that stock was 100, and final price is 40, then 40% of 1,424,000 or 569,600 will be returned to the investor.
<p>Monte Carlo was used for the pricing.  On July 20th, the value was 1,407,420, close to the initial value of 1,424,000.  On Sep 7th, the value dropped to 1,386,134 or a loss of 37,866.
<p>The lower price may be due to both higher volatility and lower spot for Face Book.  Barrier options are not volatility friendly, the higher the volatility the more likely the barrier will be breached. 
<p>This product was cited in FT Alphaville, July 20 by Dan McCrum with the challenge “Readers better able to price option values might chime in”.

<h1 style="color:blue;">Housing Prices and Pelegrini</h1>
<p class="paragraph">At a 2007 hedge fund conference in Nassau, a Paulson & Co presenter showed an interesting housing chart which has since stuck with me.  Also in 2007, John Paulson became world-famous by shorting the US housing market by betting against mortgage backed securities through credit default swaps. His firm made $14Billion and Mr. Paulson himself made $4Billion on this one trade alone.
<p>Currently, although housing prices are still increasing, the rate of change in housing prices is falling and is mirrored in the share price change this year to Jul 27 of the three S&P500 homebuilding companies: Lennar Corporation (LEN) -13.5%, D.R Horton (DHI) -19.5% and NVR Inc (NVR) -20.5%.
<p>Mr. Paulson believed that housing prices were decelerating and Paolo Pellegrini, the analyst who worked with Mr. Paulson, developed a housing price vs wage chart.  The chart below is similar and shows the year over year change in the seasonally adjusted housing price index divided by the inflation-adjusted hourly wage growth.  The impact of yields on housing costs is well known but is complex. The chart below relates to wages, a more direct approach which illustrates that regardless of cause, housing is becoming less attractive/affordable relative to wage.  (T. Murk)
<p>Var results for LEN and DHI covering 10 years are shown below.  Yield curves for other currencies can be found under market risk factors.

<h3 class="three-col-header">VaR as a Risk Measure</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Value at Risk (VaR) is one of the most popular tools used in risk management and is incorporated within the Basel Accord for banking supervision.  VaR is used by central counterparties (CCPs) for purposes of determining initial margin.  VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES) are standard measures used by traders for setting risk limits and can be used by investors, traders and risk managers both for preventing panic selling (or buying) in periods of high volatility, and also preventing overreaching in periods of low volatility.
<p> Our core solution is VaR.
<p>
<p>A click on the chart icons below for various assets and sectors, will provide a graph where the one in one hundred chance (99th percentile) breach is visible below the Current VaR red line .
