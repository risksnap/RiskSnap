	<H1>About the company</H1>
    <p>RiskSnap was founded in August 2017 by a small, passionate team that first worked together on risk projects ten years earlier. 
       Financial risk is very much in our DNA, we have a strong foundation in current regulatory risk methodologies,  
       and have built software for Monte Carlo counterparty credit risk, stress test, sensitivities to market risk, and historical VaR.
       We have set out to produce best-in-class financial risk software for corporate hedgers, investors, 
       asset managers, exchanges, and banks.
</p>
    <p>
Most of our software is written in C# or other languages in the .Net 
family.  On the server side we have a big project that will run on 
Microsoft Azure and uses C++ and C#.  This will be the core of the risk 
management system, managing financial data, responding to 
requests from controls, performing valuation and scenario generation, and serving 
results to controls.
