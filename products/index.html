<H3>RiskSpan - HVaR</H3>
<p>
<p>	RiskSpan - HVaR is a risk system that utilizes verifiable past events in order to determine the amount of risk for a trade or a portfolio of trades within the time frame required to liquidate or hedge these trades.  The system is easy to use and transparent.  All valuations within the observation periods can easily be verified, including option pricers that can price on any day in the past using the "shocked" rates and displaying the market risk parameters.  The option pricing uses market based usage of volatility surfaces.
<p>
 What-if trades can easily be added in order to view impact on the portfolio instantly.  Graphics permit areas of risk to be viewed visually.  All data, including market data shocks as well as results and trades can be downloaded easily.
<p>
The system also calculates risk on collateral, both fixed income and equities, to determine how the value of collateral could be affected during volatile times.  The results of the collateral haircuts are netted to cash balances, market value and liquidation risk of the trades to determine breaches and collateral deficits/excesses.  For market risk purposes users can supply market limits in order to view market limit excesses/breaches.
<p>
Antithetic HVar permits for viewing the risk from the counterparty's point of view since they are not the same.  Thus, it is possible to view both collateral required by the trader to manage the trade, and also the collateral that the trader should request from the counterparty.
<p>  RiskSpan also allows for netting sets, each netting set with its own parameters on percentiles, observation date ranges, and choice of whether HVaR or Expected shortfall will be used.  This would be particularly helpful where cash trades are hedged by options, thus reducing risk and the need to tie up cash in collateral.
<p>  Holding periods are at the transaction level and can be adjusted if a particular transaction appears to be difficult to liquidate due to characteristic specific to that trade.
<p>  RiskSpan calculates the shocked rates using EWMA, in order to reduce procyclicality, with flexibility on the weightings.  Clients can submit their own shocked rates if preferable.
