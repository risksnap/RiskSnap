	<H1>About the company</H1>
    <p>RiskSnap was founded in August 2017 by a small, passionate team that first worked together on risk projects ten years earlier. 
       Financial risk is very much in our DNA, we have a strong foundation in current regulatory risk methodologies,  
       and have built software that does Monte Carlo counterparty credit risk, stress test, sensitivities to market risk, 
       and historical VaR for major banks.
       </p>
       <p>
       We have set out to produce best-in-class financial risk software for banks, exchanges, corporate hedgers, 
       investors, asset managers, custodians, insurance firms, and pension fund administrators. 
       Risk analytic software of the sophistication found in major banks is invariably expensive to buy and even more expensive to
       implement, our vision is to provide software of the same quality to our clients that is economical.
       </p>

    <p>
Most of our software is written in C# or other languages in the .Net 
family.  On the server side we have a big project that will run on 
Microsoft Azure and uses C++ and C#.  This will be the core of the risk 
management system, managing financial data, responding to 
requests from controls, performing valuation and scenario generation, and serving 
results to controls. 
    Controls run on PC desktops and tablets, are lightweight, and focused on displaying
    the results of compute-intensive operations performed and cached on the core. 
    </p>
    <p>
RiskSnap's financial data management is based around a relational database management system, but with trade and 
product properties stored in JSON objects rather than the traditional fixed column layouts. This gives
more freedom and flexibility for adding new financial products going forward.
