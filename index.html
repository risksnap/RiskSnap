	<H1>About the company</H1>
    <p>RiskSnap was founded in August 2017 by a small, passionate team that first worked together on risk projects ten years earlier. 
       Financial risk is very much in our DNA, we have a strong foundation in current regulatory risk methodologies,  
       and have built software that does Monte Carlo counterparty credit risk, stress test, sensitivities to market risk, 
       and historical VaR for major banks.
       </p>
       <p>
       We have set out to produce best-in-class financial risk software for banks, exchanges, corporate hedgers, 
       investors, asset managers, custodians, insurance firms, and pension fund administrators. 
       Currently, risk analytic software of the sophistication found in major banks is expensive to buy and even more expensive to
       implement, our vision is to provide software of the same quality to our clients that is economical and 
       as easy to maintain as your digital media library.
