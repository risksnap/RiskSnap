	<p>The volatility of a portfolio is lower than the sum of the volatility of the underlying assets due to the correlation effect.  Consider a portfolio of 2 assets that are 100% negatively correlated.  There will be zero risk while this correlation is in effect.  A portfolio of 2 assets that are 100% positively correlated will generally have twice the volatility of either).  For a 2 asset portfolio, the variance can be measured as A<sup>2</sup> + &#961;AB + B<sup>2</sup> where A and B are the  volatilities and &#961; is the correlation which ranges from -1 to +1. The volatility is the square root of the variance.
    <p>
	<p>The following demonstrates how the combining of portfolios reduces the overall risk.  Notice also in the graphs, that the maximum loss for stress purposes has shifted for the put so that the one year stress period is now centered around 26 Jan 2010 as compared to 12 Nov 2008 for the long position in shares.  The put is at risk when the market price rises which took place at a different date.  In the combined portfolio, the original risk observation period is still valid since the worst case loss for the two assets together still takes place in the same date range. <a href="http://www.risksnap.com/metrics/index.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information on observation date requirements</a>.

	<p>The following illustrates the possible risk (in Thousands of dollars), using a 99% confidence interval and 2 day holding period, with at-the-money historical volatility.
<p>
<p>	There is a significant reduction in the amount at risk.  Note that there is a cost to buying this risk in the form of option premium.  In practice the cost is lowered by purchasing out-of-the money options and various risk vs cost strategies.  HVaR is useful for viewing the risk of such strategic portfolios.
