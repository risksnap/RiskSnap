    Most of our software is written in C# or other languages in the .Net 
    family.  On the server side we have a big project that will run on 
    Microsoft Azure and uses C++ and C#.  This will be the core of the risk 
    management system, managing financial data, responding to 
    requests from controls, performing valuation and scenario generation, and serving 
    results to controls. 
        Controls run on PC desktops and tablets, are lightweight, and focused on displaying
        the results of compute-intensive operations performed and cached on the core.

    RiskSnap's financial data management is based around a relational database management system, but with trade and 
    product properties stored in JSON objects rather than the traditional fixed column layouts. This gives
    more freedom and flexibility for adding new financial products going forward.
